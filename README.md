## NOTES:

	
## To do:
+ Mongo
	+ Person collection
		* job title field maybe?
	+ Skills collection
		* need a filter for skills that's only ones with children (aka parents)

+ Angular
	* better sorting on the "results " page
	* some sort of confirmation on the index page that stuff submitted
	* need the skills page to  loop over only skills with children, and to do an interior loop to show those children. 

+ Design/UI
	* work out how we're going to view a huge  table that goes really wide w/ tons of skills

## Bugs
+ Add skills page : there's weirdness when adding a skill, and then a child skill in the same session on the "add-skill page" Stuff doesn't always get added to the parent
